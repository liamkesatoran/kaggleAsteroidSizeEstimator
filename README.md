# kaggleAsteroidSizeEstimator


This is a mirror of one of my kernels of Kaggle:

Find the data here:

Dependencies:
numpy, sklearn, keras, matplotlib, seaborn

Just a simple supervised learning notebook, showing how to estimate an asteroid's size with other physical data. 
I removed some columns that gave too high correlation for curiosity and added difficulty.
